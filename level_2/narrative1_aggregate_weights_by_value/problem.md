# Problem

### Statement
Given two 2D integer arrays, `set1` and `set2`. Each array sets has the following properties:
`set[i] = [value i, weight i]` where `value i` represents the value and `weight i` represents the weight of the ith set.
The value of each set in `sets` is unique.
Return a 2D integer array `ret` where `ret[i] = [value i, weight i]`, with `weight i` being the sum of weights of all sets with value `value i`.
Note: `ret` should be returned in ascending order by value.

### Input Format
- M(Size of set1)
- set1
- N(Size of set2)
- set2
